# Neuronal vesicle release model during LPA application

Differential Equation Models for pre-synaptic vesicle release during LPA application.

The models are developed in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) using the [DifferentialEquations](https://juliapackages.com/p/differentialequations) packages. Results are presented with [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks.

## Structure

TODO: Change this to JuliaHub - investigate how to share notebook
Note: For now the notebooks are linked to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) - the way forward is to run them in NextJournal.

Starting the Binder instance (by clicking on the notebook name) might take some minutes. If in doubt, check the build logs and see if something is happening.

    Reproducing figure 5D from the [Sara 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305000693?via%3Dihub) publication.
    This is a differential equations based model of spontaneous synaptic vesicle recycling. 
    The model is based on single pool with four states and in the article fitted against experimental observation with tagged/dyed vesicles.

    This is simplified version of the Sara 2005 model with three states, omitting the recycled but no longer dyed state. This should most closely match the observations in our paper.

- [./notebook_two_states_model.jl](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonsp/pluto-on-binder/v0.14.5?urlpath=pluto/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fkonstantinstadler%252Flpa-vesicle-model%252Fblob%252Fmaster%252Fnotebook_two_states_model.jl%253Fraw%253Dtrue)

    A even more simple model with a resting pool and a recycling rate. Seems too simple for our application.

## Background Papers

[Sara 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305000693?via%3Dihub) have a differential equation based model

[Truckenbrodt and Rizzolo 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2014.00409/full) on the different observations from Sara 2005 and others

around 200 vesicle in one hippocampal synapse [Fowler 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482715000920?via%3Dihub) - in this paper also a good explanation of the sizes of the different pools. Also points again to different pools for spontaneous release  ... but the same vesicles are in both pools [Wilhelm et al 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2690)


[Kvalali 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3875) - different pools based on their reliance on dynamin function. In their are also comprehensive schemata of synapses

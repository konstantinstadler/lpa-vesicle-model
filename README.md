# Neuronal vesicle release model during LPA application


## Papers

[Sara 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305000693?via%3Dihub) have a differential equation based model

[Truckenbrodt and Rizzolo 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2014.00409/full) on the different observations from Sara 2005 and others

around 200 vesicle in one hippocampal synapse [Fowler 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482715000920?via%3Dihub) - in this paper also a good explanation of the sizes of the different pools. Also points again to different pools for spontaneous release  ... but the same vesicles are in both pools [Wilhelm et al 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2690)


[Kvalali 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3875) - different pools based on their reliance on dynamin function. In their are also comprehensive schemata of synapses
